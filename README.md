Wanna live my life like yesterday\
Never feeling down, never feeling down\
Woke up in another new day\
Something has changed, don't feel the same\
Alone, hearing voices in my head\
Thought that I had it all, but it feels like nobody cares, nobody cares\
In a Tiffany dress, get off from white 벤\
Walk the red carpet, 밝게 터지는 flash\
모든 세상의 관심, 수많은 fans\
그래, 사랑에 배가 부른 거지\
매일 꿈꾸던 삶이야\
그리고 꿈이 없어진 삶이야\
대체 얼마나 대단한 걸 더 가져야?\
행복할까? 궁금한 밤이야\
Love and fame, it seems to be enough\
When the truth is not that beautiful\
Tears and pain are things I've never shown\
No one knows, no one knows, no one knows\
They think I'm okay, think I'm okay\
Wanna live my life like yesterday\
Never feeling down, never feeling down\
In the clouds, just stay there everyday\
Never coming down, never coming down\
Life has ups and downs, just realized\
Nothing lasts forever, yeah\
One day, if I fall, would you smile\
And say you'll be there for me?\
I've been lying awake these days\
Can't get away, everyone changes\
Every time you smile, don't you pretend\
Ask myself every night and realize things won't be the same, won't be the same\
Love and fame, it seems to be enough\
When the truth is not that beautiful\
Tears and pain are things I've never shown\
No one knows, no one knows, no one knows\
That I'm not okay, I'm not okay\
Wanna live my life like yesterday\
Never feeling down, never feeling down\
In the clouds, just stay there everyday\
Never coming down, never coming down\
Life has ups and downs, it's alright\
Nothing lasts forever, yeah\
One day I will fall, can't deny\
But I know you won't leave\
Wanna live my life like yesterday\
Never feeling down, never feeling down\
In the clouds, just stay there everyday\
Never coming down, never coming down\
